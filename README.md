# Dynamic_Vehicle_Control_using_RL

This project is done as a part of coursework ECE 542 by Reddy Aravind, Siddhesh Gotad and Shahryar Rashid.

It focuses on Dynamic Vehicle Controlling using Reinforcement Learning.

The simulation is fed as an input to the Algorithm and the Deep Reinforcement Algorithm defines the path to be taken to follow the predescribed route while training.

More details are added further.
